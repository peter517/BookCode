We meet in the night in the Spanish cafe 
I look in your eyes just don't know what to say 
It feels like I'm drowning in salty water 
A few hours left 'til the sun's gonna rise 
tomorrow will come an it's time to realize 
our love has finished forever 
how I wish to come with you (wish to come with you)  
how I wish we make it through га 
Just one last dance 
before we say goodbye  
when we sway and turn round and round and round 
it's like the first time 
Just one more chance 
hold me tight and keep me warm  
cause the night is getting cold 
and I don't know where I belong  
Just one last dance
